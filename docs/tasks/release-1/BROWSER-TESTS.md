# Deferred browser verification checklist

The unattended run cannot touch a live browser, so every verification step
that needs one accumulates here. Run this file top to bottom when you return.

## Before you start (once)

1. Close and restart the MCP client (Claude Code) so it launches the rebuilt
   binary from the release-1-hardening branch build.
   Note: if you want to test WITHOUT merging, build/install from the branch
   first; the registered binary path is what the client launches.
2. Reload the extension at chrome://extensions (Reload button on the dev
   extension).
3. Confirm basic liveness: ask the agent for a screenshot of any page. If
   that fails, run `browser-mcp doctor` (T07) and check --debug state files
   before proceeding.

## Format for entries (agent: follow exactly)

```
## T<NN>-<n>: <one-line purpose>
Changed: <what behavior changed, one sentence>
Steps:
1. <exact instruction, with URL and element>
2. ...
Expect: <the observable result that means PASS, per step where needed>
```

Entries below are appended by the unattended agent, in task order.
